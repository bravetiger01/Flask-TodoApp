File Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

index.html: The main page that displays the list of tasks and provides forms for adding, updating, and deleting tasks.
search.html: The search page that displays the search results.
app.py: The Flask application file that handles requests and responses.
templates/: The directory that contains the HTML templates.

Topics Covered
Template Inheritance: The project uses template inheritance to create a consistent layout for all pages. The base.html file provides the basic structure, and the other templates inherit from it to add their own content.
Jinja2 Templating: The project uses Jinja2 templating engine to render dynamic data in the templates. This allows for easy separation of presentation and logic.
Flask Routing: The project uses Flask's routing system to handle requests and responses. This allows for easy mapping of URLs to application endpoints.
Form Handling: The project uses Flask's form handling system to handle form submissions and validate user input.
Database Interactions: The project uses Flask's database interactions system to interact with the database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
